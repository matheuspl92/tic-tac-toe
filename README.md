This project consists in a tic tac toe browser game. The main objective was to exercise code structuring and Javascript skills. As a challenge to myself I implemented the minimax algorithm to create an unbeatable AI.

**Skills demonstrated**:

    - Intermediate HTML, CSS and Javascript coding skills;
    - Good understanding of complex algorithms;
    - Good debugging skills;
    - Good commit history;
    - Good code structuring (Function factories, modules, private methods etc).
